# VM

We choose to use [Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS - Server](http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/) to create the VM because some modules and dependencies are not totaly compatible with other SOs or Ubuntu latest version. If you prefer, you can try to do it and contribute with us sending some success work.

## 1 â€“ Create a Ubuntu VM

We used [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to host the VM. We suggest these configuration bellow:

```
- Disk space: 20GB
- Memory: 3GB
- Processor: 2 or more cores
- Network: 1 NIC (with Internet access)
```
When you finished to create your Ubuntu VM, you can install all softwares needed. Start [here](https://github.com/emersonbarea/testes/blob/master/NS-3_DCE_CCN.md).
